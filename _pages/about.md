<!-- **Daqian Shi** -->

Hi, welcome to my site! Glad to have you here! ðŸ‘‹

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI), Queen Mary University of London. I received my master's degree from the University of Manchester, UK, and PhD from the University of Trento, Italy. Additionally, I had the privilege of being a visiting Ph.D. student at the University College London, UK. Furthermore, I have been a research assistant at Jilin Unievrsity, China.
