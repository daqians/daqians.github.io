Research Group
------------------
We are dedicated to harnessing the power of AI to address complex scientific challenges. We focus on developing AI systems that are applicable across diverse scientific fields and real-world applications. Our key areas of interest include Few-shot learning, AI for Science, especially AI for Healthcare, computer vision, multi-modality learning, large language models (LLMs), and embodied AI. We believe that these advanced tools, when effectively utilized, have the potential to drive significant breakthroughs in understanding intricate systems and solving real-world problems through intelligent, adaptive, and data-driven methods.
