### Description:
Interactive argument pair identification is an emerging research task in natural language processing (NLP), aiming to select the argumentatively related reply of the quotation from a set of candidate replies. It is essential to utilize contexts since contextual information is related to the meaning of the quotation and reply. However, directly modelling the entire context will introduce a large amount of redundant information, which further influence the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetric mutual learning framework to to efficiently transfer knowledge to each other between context and quotation or reply. The context-aware branch and context-unaware branch are optimised jointly and collaboratively. Moreover, a context clip module is proposed to dynamically clip the contexts, which aims to remove redundant information and preserve related information. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark dataset.
