### Description:
In this paper, we introduce ACCID, an ancient Chinese character image set with multiple types of annotations, including character categories, structures, radical categories, and radical locations. ACCID aims to complement a benchmark for zero-shot character recognition tasks. Meanwhile, we propose a baseline method to analyze the usability and challenges of ACCID. We evaluate ACCID from various perspectives, and experimental results show that annotations in ACCID are high-quality and reliable. In the future, we will continue to collect more ancient Chinese character images and corresponding annotations in character, radical, and structural levels to enlarge the dataset. Overall, as a newly proposed benchmark, we believe ACCID moves us toward zero-shot character recognition, which is valuable to deal with unbalanced samples in real-world application scenarios.
