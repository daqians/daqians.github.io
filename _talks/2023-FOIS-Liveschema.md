### Description:
One of the significant barriers to the training of statistical models on \textit{knowledge graphs} is the difficulty that scientists have in finding the best input data to address their prediction goal. In addition to this, a key challenge is to determine how to manipulate these \textit{relational data}, which are often in the form of particular triples (i.e., \textit{subject}, \textit{predicate}, \textit{object}), to enable the learning process. Currently, many high-quality catalogs of knowledge graphs, are available. However, their primary goal is the re-usability of these resources, and their interconnection, in the context of the \textit{Semantic Web}. This paper describes the \textit{LiveSchema} initiative, namely, the first version of a gateway that has the main scope of leveraging the gold mine of data collected by many existing \textit{catalogs} collecting relational data like ontologies and knowledge graphs. At the current state, LiveSchema contains $\sim1000$ datasets from 4 main sources and offers some key facilities, which allow to: \textit{i)} evolving LiveSchema, by aggregating other source catalogs and repositories as input sources; \textit{ii)} querying all the collected resources; \textit{iii)} transforming each given dataset into formal concept analysis matrices that enable analysis and visualization services; \textit{iv)} generating models and tensors from each given dataset.
