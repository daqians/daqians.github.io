### Description: 
Oracle bone inscriptions are a treasure of Chinese culture. It is precisely because of their discovery that the recorded history of China was extended backward by about a thousand years. At the same time, oracle bone inscriptions are the origin of modern Chinese characters and the earliest known systematic writing in China. This determines their irreplaceable status and unique value. As a precious asset shared by humanity, oracle bone inscriptions have been included in the "Memory of the World Register."

Oracle bone studies have become an interdisciplinary field, providing "nourishment" for historians, linguists, and archaeologists alike.
- For historians, oracle bone inscriptions serve as historical records;
- For linguists, they are a valuable corpus;
- For archaeologists, oracle bones are the cultural remains of ancient humans.

Of course, oracle bone inscriptions can also be combined with various other disciplines. For example, by using records of solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, and meteor showers found in oracle bones, they can be connected with astronomy; by applying paleontological knowledge, one can trace the sources of the materials like tortoise shells and ox bones. In tracing the early history of various phenomena, many clues can be found in oracle bone inscriptions.
