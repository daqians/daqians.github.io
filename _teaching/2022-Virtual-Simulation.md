### Course Objectives and Outcomes

Digital Humanities is the intellectual activity that applies digital technology to the humanities. Digital humanities projects are characterized by "single thematic domains," "multiple functional integration," "multi-disciplinary attributes," and "knowledge integration orientation." In this project, Chinese ancient character data, represented by oracle bone inscriptions, bronze inscriptions, and Chu bamboo slips, are usually preserved in the form of rubbings of related artifacts. The surfaces of these artifacts are covered with corrosion marks. The course aims to train students to master scientific methods for the digitization of artifacts.

Many ancient forms of writing, such as oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, were carved or written on turtle shells and animal bones. The understanding and systematic excavation of these texts, as well as the training of students in related disciplines, are often based on online images and book records. However, the characteristics of ancient scripts pose challenges: firstly, they are highly pictographic. For example, oracle bone inscriptions are highly iconic, meaning their shapes convey meanings directly. This characteristic limits practical activities such as recognition, restoration, and interpretation of ancient scripts for archaeology and artificial intelligence (AI) students. Practical training is crucial for developing engineering skills, innovation, and creativity in students studying archaeology, AI, and interdisciplinary subjects like digital humanities.

Through virtual simulation experiments, students can photograph and sample artifacts based on their corrosion and damage conditions, compare them, and use AI algorithms for image denoising and recognition. They can independently design and build a knowledge graph of ancient scripts and create related intelligent applications. This effectively trains students' ability to innovate across disciplines. Through digital operations, information on ancient script artifacts can be quickly searched and analyzed like modern data, which has significant implications for artifact preservation, philology, and historical studies.

Since the artifacts are stored in museums across the country and cannot be fully photographed or handled, it is difficult to conduct comprehensive observation and digital operations within limited learning time and conditions. Moreover, conventional courses usually focus on algorithm instruction, requiring students to spend a lot of time learning and implementing various image processing algorithms and knowledge graph construction algorithms. This makes it challenging to efficiently explore the application effects of different algorithms and knowledge organization schemes in the field of ancient texts, thus hindering the training of students in interdisciplinary application and innovation. To enhance the learning effectiveness of the course, save practical time and cost, and adopt a project-driven teaching approach, the "Digital Humanities Simulation Experiment" was developed.

### Course Description
The virtual simulation experiment project can achieve the following objectives:

**Skill Objectives**: Enable students to develop application and innovation abilities of AI algorithms in interdisciplinary fields, strengthen their skills in discovering, analyzing, and solving real-world problems across different domains; master knowledge organization and application skills, and understand the basic methods of constructing knowledge graphs and their application to ancient script datasets.

**Knowledge Objectives**: Master the basic knowledge of ancient scripts, understand the characteristics of related artifacts and the needs for their digital processing; grasp the basic principles of image denoising algorithms and the application of several such algorithms in ancient script images; understand the basic principles of character recognition algorithms and the application of related algorithms to ancient script images.

**Attitudinal, Emotional, and Value Objectives**: Foster students' interest in learning the interdisciplinary knowledge of ancient scripts and AI, and cultivate their innovative mindset. By creating immersive scenarios, encourage practical exploration, inspire students' love for archaeological culture, and reinforce a sense of patriotism.
